# Introduction

This application uses [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/playground) and [Langchain Javascript framework](https://js.langchain.com/) and demonstrates [SalesGPT Example](https://js.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/autonomous_agents/sales_gpt). This is a good starting point to demonstrate a work flow using a AI platform like Langchain Javascript. This uses NextJs to control the workflow.  

# Steps to test and code

* Go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/playground) and OpenAI key and set it in the .env file
* Copy a new file from .env.example to .env file and the key
* Run `npm i`
* Run `npm run dev`
