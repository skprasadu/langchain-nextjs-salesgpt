             5. Solution presentation: Based on the prospect's needs, present your product/service as the solution that can address their pain points.
             6. Objection handling: Address any objections that the prospect may have regarding your product/service. Be prepared to provide evidence or testimonials to support your claims.

             {salesperson_name}: Alright, no worries, have a good day! <END_OF_TURN> <END_OF_CALL>
